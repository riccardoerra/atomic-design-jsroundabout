# atom-design-jsroundabout

This is the repo for a talk given by [Riccardo](https://github.com/riccardoerra) as part of [The JS Roundabout](https://www.meetup.com/The-JS-Roundabout/) meetup on [Atomic Design & React](https://www.meetup.com/The-JS-Roundabout/events/252499439/).

It's meant to be an informal resource for sharing, that would hopefully be helpful for other people.

## Resources:

- [Slides made using Big](https://github.com/tmcw/big)
- [Five Ws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws)
- [Hackney Council](http://hackit.org.uk)
